# Javascript-game<br>
Final for JCCC JavaScript class. Made in May 2018. <br>
Here is the rubric that I pulled from the following site. <li>http://students.jccc.edu/lisalfri/web114/final/instructions.html</li>
<br>
Steps:

Create a well-formed, semantically correct html page. Include appropriate wireframe tags.
Include a div to wrap all content in the body.
Set the width of wrapper div to less than 100% and center the div.
Review the list of required items below, incorporating them into your JavaScript game.
Validate your html and css.
Spell check all content.
Your page should follow responsive web design principles.
All measurements should be flexible. (em and %).
Images should be flexible. e.g. { max-width: 100% }, no height= or width= attributes in html.
meta viewport tag should be added. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Two media queries for tablet and phone size should be added.
@media only screen and (max-width: 64em) for tablet
@media only screen and (max-width: 37.5em) for phone
All css and JavaScript should be stored in external files.
All files should be properly documented with your name and the current date.
Your game should demonstrate and use this list of JavaScript knowledge (but it is not limited to this list):

include a JavaScript comment to identify each of these requirements in your js file
document.getElementById("something1").innerHTML (probably a block element such as a p or h2 tag)
document.getElementById("something2").value (probably an input element)
document.getElementsByTagName
document.getElementById("something3").style (to change a style for id="something3")
document.querySelectorAll(".something4") (to change a style for class="something4")
window.prompt()
window.alert()
var
for
if ... else
while
switch
array
create several custom functions to process your game
addEventListener() to trigger all code
console.log() to follow and debug your code -- leave these in the js file
include all operations, conditional operators, and logical operators on page 104 (but not p. 105). **Note this is a long list!**
note that conditional operators are more fully explained starting at page 118.
note that logical operators are more fully explained starting at page 123.
