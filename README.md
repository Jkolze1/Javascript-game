# Javascript-game<br>
Final for JCCC JavaScript class.  <br>
Here is the rubric that I pulled from the following site. <li>http://students.jccc.edu/lisalfri/web114/final/instructions.html</li>
<br>
Requirements:

Create a well-formed, semantically correct html page. Include appropriate wireframe tags.<br>
Include a div to wrap all content in the body.<br>
Set the width of wrapper div to less than 100% and center the div.<br>
Review the list of required items below, incorporating them into your JavaScript game.<br>
Validate your html and css. <br>
Spell check all content.<br>
Your page should follow responsive web design principles.<br>
All measurements should be flexible. (em and %).<br>
Images should be flexible. e.g. { max-width: 100% }, no height= or width= attributes in html.<br>
meta viewport tag should be added. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"><br>
Two media queries for tablet and phone size should be added.<br>
@media only screen and (max-width: 64em) for tablet <br>
@media only screen and (max-width: 37.5em) for phone <br>
All css and JavaScript should be stored in external files. <br>
All files should be properly documented with your name and the current date. <br>
Your game should demonstrate and use this list of JavaScript knowledge (but it is not limited to this list):<br>

include a JavaScript comment to identify each of these requirements in your js file <br>
document.getElementById("something1").innerHTML (probably a block element such as a p or h2 tag) <br>
document.getElementById("something2").value (probably an input element) <br>
document.getElementsByTagName <br>
document.getElementById("something3").style (to change a style for id="something3")<br>
document.querySelectorAll(".something4") (to change a style for class="something4") <br>
window.prompt() <br>
window.alert() <br>
var <br>
for <br>
if ... else <br>
while <br>
switch <br>
array <br>
create several custom functions to process your game <br>
addEventListener() to trigger all code <br>
console.log() to follow and debug your code -- leave these in the js file <br>
include all operations, conditional operators, and logical operators on page 104 (but not p. 105). **Note this is a long list!** <br>
note that conditional operators are more fully explained starting at page 118. <br>
note that logical operators are more fully explained starting at page 123.<br>
